    <h4> Program that I chose </h4>
    <p> I chose the data science program from the Unitversity of Ottawa. I chose this university because it's in the same city as my house so I would be able to live with my parents so I don't have to pay rent and worry about living by myself. </p>
    <h4> Entrance requirements </h4>
    <p>The prerequisites for this program are: </p>
    <ul>
      <li> English 4U or Fran√ßais 4U </li>
      <li> Advanced Functions 4U </li>
      <li> Calculus and Vectors 4U </li>
    </ul>
    <p> The minimum average for all of these mandatory prerequisites is 70% but the admission average for data science is low to mid 90s </p>
    <h4> First year courses </h4>
    <p> According to the course sequence for a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science in 2020-2021, there are 8 courses for a first year in university: </p>
    <ul>
      <li> ENG 1112 | Technical Report Writing </li>
      <li> ITI 1120 | Introduction to Computing I </li>
      <li> MAT 1320 | Calculus I </li>
      <li> MAT 1341 | Introduction to Linear Algebra </li>
      <li> ITI 1100 | Digital Systems I </li>
      <li> ITI 1121 | Introduction to Computing II </li>
      <li> MAT 1322 | Calculus II </li>
      <li> MAT 1348 | Discrete Mathematics for Computing </li>
    </ul>
    <p> And you get two courses in which you can pick two electives. </p>
    <h4> Other things you might need for the diploma </h4>
    <p> During each year of university, you need to take electives, just like in high school. Electives are classes that you can take for credits but the classes themselves aren't necessary for your degree. Some elective classes you can take include: Anthropology, Criminology, Hebrew, Journalism, etc... </p>
    <h4> How long would it take to get the degree? </h4>
    <p> According to the course sequence for a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science in 2020-2021, there are mandatory classes for 4 years and in year 5 you only take optional courses. So if you wanted to get your degree as fast as possible, it would take you 4 years. </p>
    <h4> The Cathechism of the Catholic Church </h4>
    <p> My vocation helps me become a better person. It pushes me to become a good samaritan. I believe that my vocation is like a beacon of light in the darkness of the world. Becoming a data engineer is following my vocation because data engineers make the world a better place. They support data scientists and their job is important to each companie that is related to technology in any way. My vocation helps the common good because I try to be a good samaritan. It leads me to be the bigger person and strive to be better than the me from yesterday. </p>
