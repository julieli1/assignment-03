    <h4> Program that I chose </h4>
    <p> I chose the data science program from the Unitversity of Ottawa. I chose this university because it's in the same city as my house so I would be able to live with my parents so I don't have to pay rent and worry about living by myself. </p>
    <h4> Entrance requirements </h4>
    <p>The prerequisites for this program are: </p>
    <ul>
      <li> English 4U or Fran√ßais 4U </li>
      <li> Advanced Functions 4U </li>
      <li> Calculus and Vectors 4U </li>
    </ul>
    <p> The minimum average for all of these mandatory prerequisites is 70% but the admission average for data science is low to mid 90s </p>
    <h4> First year courses </h4>
    <p> According to the course sequence for a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science in 2020-2021, there are 8 courses for a first year in university: </p>
    <ul>
      <li> ENG 1112 | Technical Report Writing </li>
      <li> ITI 1120 | Introduction to Computing I </li>
      <li> MAT 1320 | Calculus I </li>
      <li> MAT 1341 | Introduction to Linear Algebra </li>
      <li> ITI 1100 | Digital Systems I </li>
      <li> ITI 1121 | Introduction to Computing II </li>
      <li> MAT 1322 | Calculus II </li>
      <li> MAT 1348 | Discrete Mathematics for Computing </li>
    </ul>
    <p> And you get two courses in which you can pick two electives. </p>
    <h4> Other things you might need for the diploma </h4>
    <p> not done yet bc i'm not sure </p>
    <h4> How long would it take to get the degree? </h4>
    <p> According to the course sequence for a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science in 2020-2021, there are mandatory classes for 4 years and in year 5 you only take optional courses. So if you wanted to get your degree as fast as possible, it would take you 4 years. </p>
