    <h4> Brief Description </h4>
    <p> Data engineers are the people who transform data into formats that data scientists can use. They primarily focus on developing reliable mechanisms or infrastructure for data collection. </p>
    <h4> Education </h4>
    <p> To become a data engineer, you need to get a  bachelorâ€™s degree in computer science or programming, or a related field. You can also get a master's in data engineering. I don't think this is mandatory, but it shows that you put in extra effort to hone your skills, which is something companies want, so it would help you compared to somone who doesn't have a master's degree in data engineering. </p>
    <h4> Outlook </h4>
    <p> The outlook on data engineering is pretty good. The demand for this job is increasing, as technology advances. According to a research done by IBM, the demand for data engineers and scientists will increase by 28 percent in the next three years, so I think the outlook for data engineers is good, and getting better. </p>
    <h4> Salary Range </h4>
    <p> The salary range for data engineering is from 50k to 100k, the meadian being 80k dollars for annual salary. </p>
    <h4> Would I want to become a data engineer? </h4>
    <p> Definitely! I think data engineeing is a very interesting job. My brother is a data engineer so I see him work sometimes and it all looks very interesting. I also feel like data engineers and under-apreciated because the glory goes to data scientists, so I want to make data engineers feel more apreciated, because data scientists can only do their job properly if data engineers give them good data to use. </p>
